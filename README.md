Baking! in Factorio!

Overhauls game to be all about baking. All science packs are changed to be things you must bake.

To mix in even more fun, check out [Baketorio+](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/baketorio_plus) expansion by [Edenstudent](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Edenstudent)

## FAQ

Q: How do I select the right nutrient recipe?

A: The NutriGen tool that will open whenever inside an assembling machine. There is a two item selector that will show in the top left of your sceen when inside an assembler. Select your desired inputs, and the selector will update the recipe to be a compatible nutrient.

To go the other way around, I recommend looking at the icons on the nutrient recipes to determine what is needed.

Q: Is this compatible with space-age?

A: Yes! It doesn't use or require ANY features from the expansion. That might change in the future, but the plan is to keep the mod usable by anyone, with or without the expansion.
